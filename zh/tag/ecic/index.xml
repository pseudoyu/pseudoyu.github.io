      <description>A Look at Tik-Tok Given there are many social media platforms already existing in US, what makes Tik-Tok so successful that it becomes a big enough threat to cause the US Government to act the way it did towards a commercial company (ignore political factors)? Economically, at about 2016, US tech giants such as Facebook or Google mainly focused on long video platform instead of the short video platform. A company called Musical.</description>

      <description>Mobile Payment Systems Why has China been an ideal environment to support mobile payment systems? Politically, payment licenses are controlled by government (relative financial institutions) and under strict regulation. So, tech giants like Alibaba who are qualified can increasingly develop their payment business in the early age. Plus, in the early stage of mobile payment, laws and rules are not so completed. Payment platform can utilize smart market strategies (like very high return rate) to attract more new potential users and enhance existing users’ engagement, which is effective in market expanding stage.</description>

The iPad Air 4 (2020) got shown off at Apple&amp;rsquo;s September event held on September 16. There is a specific designed website (mobile version included) for this product. I&amp;rsquo;d like to do an analysis towards this very impressive E-Commerce presence.
Apple iPad Air product line is mainly targeted to educators/students, staffs and kids/teenagers. So, the most premium features this new product wants to convey to customers is its fancy appearance and powerful A14 Bionic for creation, study and entertainment.</description>
