      <description>COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Topic 3 Adversarial Search A Multi-agent Competitive Environment
 Other agents are planning against us Goals are in conflict (not necessarily)  Game Definition
 A game can be defined as  s : States s0: Initial state Player(s) : Defines which player has the move Actions(s) : Returns a set of legal moves Result(s,a) : Defines the result of a move TerminalTest(s) : True when game is over, false otherwise Utility(s,p) : Defines the final numeric value for a game that ends in terminal state s for player p   A game tree can be constructed  Nodes are game states and edges are moves    Tic-Tac-Toe Game Tree</description>

      <description>COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Topic 2 Beyond Classical Search Planning vs Identification
 Planing: sequence of actions  The path to the goal is the important thing Paths have various costs, depths Heuristics to guide, frontier to keep backups   Identification: assignments to variables  The goal itself is important, not the path    Local Search can find solutions faster for specific types of identification problems</description>

      <description>COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Topic 1 Solving Problems by Searching Types of Search
 Uninformed Search (Know nothing about the problem except definition) Informed Search (know something more like how close to the goal) Local Search (Randomly initilize a state and make it better, e.g. Deep Learning) Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Know more about the problem) Adversarial Search (have an opponent, e.g. chess, star craft game)  Is Search the same as Unsupervised/Supervised Learning?</description>
