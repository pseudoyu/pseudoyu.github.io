      <description>COMP7103 Data Mining Topic 3 Clustering Cluster Analysis Finding groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups
Application  Understanding  Group related documents for browsing, group genes and proteins that have similar functionality, or group stocks with similar price fluctuations   Summarization  Reduce size of large data sets    Types of Clusterings  Partitional Clustering  A division data objects into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) such that each data object is in exactly one subset    Hierarchical clustering  A set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchical tree    Other Distinctions Between Sets of Clusters  Exclusive versus non-exclusive  In non-exclusive clusterings, points may belong to multiple clusters Can represent multiple classes or &amp;lsquo;border&amp;rsquo; points   Fuzzy versus non-fuzzy  In fuzzy clustering, a point belongs to every cluster with some weight between 0 and 1 Weights must sum to 1 Probabilistic clustering has similar characteristics   Partial versus complete  In some cases, we only want to cluster some of the data   Heterogeneous versus homogeneous  Cluster of widely different sizes, shapes, and densities      Well-separated clusters A cluster is a set of points such that any point in a cluster is closer (or more similar) to every other point in the cluster than to any point not in the cluster</description>

      <description>COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Topic 3 Adversarial Search A Multi-agent Competitive Environment
 Other agents are planning against us Goals are in conflict (not necessarily)  Game Definition
 A game can be defined as  s : States s0: Initial state Player(s) : Defines which player has the move Actions(s) : Returns a set of legal moves Result(s,a) : Defines the result of a move TerminalTest(s) : True when game is over, false otherwise Utility(s,p) : Defines the final numeric value for a game that ends in terminal state s for player p   A game tree can be constructed  Nodes are game states and edges are moves    Tic-Tac-Toe Game Tree</description>

      <description>COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Topic 2 Beyond Classical Search Planning vs Identification
 Planing: sequence of actions  The path to the goal is the important thing Paths have various costs, depths Heuristics to guide, frontier to keep backups   Identification: assignments to variables  The goal itself is important, not the path    Local Search can find solutions faster for specific types of identification problems</description>

      <description>COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Topic 1 Solving Problems by Searching Types of Search
 Uninformed Search (Know nothing about the problem except definition) Informed Search (know something more like how close to the goal) Local Search (Randomly initilize a state and make it better, e.g. Deep Learning) Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Know more about the problem) Adversarial Search (have an opponent, e.g. chess, star craft game)  Is Search the same as Unsupervised/Supervised Learning?</description>
